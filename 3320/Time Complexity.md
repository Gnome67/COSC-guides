Big O Notation is the efficiency and growth of an algorithm.
F = O(g) if there is a constant c > 0 such that f(n) <= c * g(n)

How do we measure efficiency?
Count the operations (e.g. count the number of times a certain operation is called)
Take the biggest exponential when determining time complexity (the worst time complexity)
