Note: a subsequence is a substring of a sequence that is not necessarily contiguous

Example: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

[1,2,3] and [4,5,6] are subsequences, but [1,3,5] and [2,4,6] can also be subsequences.

# Longest Bitonic Subsequences

Call a sequence X[1..n] of numbers if there is an index i with 1 < i < n, such that the prefix X[1..i] is increasing and the suffix X [i .. n] is decreasing.
Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest bitonic subsequence of an arbitrary array X of integers.

Input format:
first line is a single number n
the following line consists of n numbers that is the array A[1..n]

This problem requires two other important Dynamic Programming Algorithms:
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LISC)
- Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS)

Weâ€™ll calculate the longest increasing subsequence for A[0...i]. And then calculate the longest decreasing subsequence for A[i....N].

# Longest Increasing Subsequences

Given an integer n, and an array nums, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

For example: the LIS of [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18] is [2, 3, 7, 101]

1. We can create a cache of the length n.
2. Then iterate through each element in nums from i = 1 to i = n-1.?
- For each element at index i, iterate through the elements before it, [0... i-1]
  - Check if nums[i] < nums[j]
  - Check if LIS[j] > LIS[i]
    - If true, this results in a longer subsequence
3. Increment the LIS value at i
- Return the LIS value.

```py
function longest_increasing_subsequence(n, nums):
  LIS = n length array initialized to [0...0]
  LIS[0] = 1
  for i from 1 to n:
    for j in i:
      if nums[j] < nums[i] and LIS[j] > LIS[i]:
        LIS[i] = LIS[j]
      LIS[i] += 1
  return LIS
```

# Longest Decreasing Subsequences

Follow the same algorithm as the longest increasing subsequence, but this time reverse both iterations.
- Outer for loop: from n-1 to 0
- Inner for loop: from n to i + 1

```py
function longest_decreasing_subsequence(n, nums):
  LDS = n length array initialized to [0...0]
  LDS[0] = 1
  for i from n to 0:
    for j from n to i+1:
      if nums[j] < nums[i] and LDS[j] > LDS[i]:
        LDS[i] = LDS[j]
      LDS[i] += 1
  return LDS
```

# Longest Bitonic Subsequences Continued

Recall that the Longest Bitonic Subsequence is the LIS from A[0...i] and the LDS from [i...N]
- So the length of the longest bitonic subsequence is the length of the LIS[i] and LDS[i] subtracted by 1, as A[i] is included in both.

We can thus understand the Longest Bitonic Subsequence as the following definition: `LBS = max(LBS, LIS[i] + LDS[i]-1)`

```py
function longest_bitonic_subsequence(n, nums):
  if n == 0:
    return 0

  LIS = longest_increasing_subsequence(n,nums)
  LDS = longest_decreasing_subsequence(n, nums)

  LBS = 1
  for i in n:
    LBS = max(LBS, LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1)
  return LBS
```

# Longest Common Subsequences

Find the length of the longest common subsequence of two strings

Example:
- s1: "ABCDGH"
- s2: "AEDFHR"

Solution:
- s1: "**A**BC**D**G**H**"
- s2: "**A**E**D**F**H**R"

The longest common subsequence is "ADH" since both strings have an A, a D, and a H in the same order, so we return 3

Example:
- s1: "AGGTAB"
- s2: "GXTXAYB"

Solution:
- s1: "AG**GTAB**"
- s2: "**G**X**T**X**A**Y**B**"

The longest common subsequence is "GTAB" since both strings have a G, a T, an A, and a B in the same order, so we return 4

Visualization:

Make a 2-D table where the rows are one string and the columns are another, which summarize function calls
```
   A G G T A B
 G 0 1 1 1 1 1
 X 0 1 1 1 1 1
 T 0 1 1 2 2 2
 X 0 1 1 2 2 2
 A 0 1 1 2 3 3
 Y 0 1 1 2 3 3
 B 0 1 1 2 3 4
 ```

We are basically matching the string up to the row we're on to the string up to the column we're on.
1. First, we compare "A" (column 1) to "G" (row 1) and see they have nothing in common, so we return 0. 
2. We move over one column ("AG"), and we see "AG" (column 1, 2) and "G" (row 1) have 1 thing in common (both have a G) so we return 1.
3. "AG" (column 1 and 2), "AGG" (column 1, 2, 3), "AGGT" (column 1, 2, 3, 4), "AGGTA" (column 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), "AGGTAB" (column 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) all have a G in common with "G" so they all return 1.
4. "AGGTAB" (all columns) continues to have only 1 thing in common with "GX" (row 1, 2), which is "G" so the entire row of X (row 2) returns 1
5. Once we reach T, "GXT" (row 1, 2, 3) will only have one thing in common with "AG" and "AGG", which is G.
6. However once we reach "AGGT" it will have 2 things in common with "GXT" which is G and T. Since they now share G and T, it is now updated to 2 in the table.
- (Remember subsequences don't have to be contiguous)
7. So on and so forth until we reach "AGGTAB" compared to "GXTXAYB" which share "G" "T" "A" "B", so we return 4.

Recursive Solution in C++:
```cpp
int LCS(string A, string B, int i, int j)
{
  if(A[i] == " " || B[j] == " ")
  {
    return 0;
  }
  else if (A[i] == B[j])
    return 1 + LCS(A, B, i+1, j+1);
  else
    return max(LCS(i+1, j), LCS(i, j+1));
}
```

Dynamic Programming Solution in C++
```cpp
void LCS(string A, string B, int i, int j)
{
  if(A[i] = B[j])
  {
    LCS[i, j] = 1 + LCS[i-1, j-1]
  }
  else
  {
    LCS[i,j] = max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1])
  }
}
```
